		In the wee hours of Monday the 20th Michelle started feeling contractions. By 3:00 AM Michelle woke William up
		and let him know this was for real. William casually downloaded
		a contraction timing app on his phone and timed a few. Contractions were happening about every 10 minutes. 
	</p>
	<p>
		By about 10:30 we the contractions told us it was time to pack the car and get ready to go. So we dropped the
		Netflix in the mailbox and headed for Fairview Hospital, arriving at around 11:30. We parked the car and went to
		the pregnancy triage center where they confirmed that yes, Michelle was pregnant and in labor so they should
		probably give us a room.
	</p>
	<p>
		After a few hours of contractions Michelle was very tired after not sleeping and we agreed she should get an epidural.
		She now counts the three smartest decisions she's every made as <ol><li>Saying yes when William asked her to marry him</li>
		<li>Wanting to have a child</li>
		<li>Getting an epidural</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
	<p>     The epidural took effect around 3:00 and she was able to get some much needed sleep. Then we told each other how much we
		loved each other and mediated for awhile. Before we knew it, the nurses told us it was time to push. We had a Certified Nurse Midwife,
		a Registered Nurse and a Student Nurse in the room with us. All of whom were great and very helpful. Thank you Nurses!
		</p>
	<p>	
		As you can imagine, Michelle was great at bearing down. She kept saying "I'm so glad I get to finally use my ab muscles!"
		Dad did lot of leg holding and general marveling. Michelle picked out an eclectic birth mix so even Snoop Dog was encouraging 
		her to drop it like it's hot. After about an hour and a half a rainbow flew out of Michelle and Mother and Child were soon reunited. Hakon's immediate
		reaction was to let loose his bowels all over Mom.
	</p>
	<p> 	Hakon and Mom passed all their tests and we got home from the hospital on Wednesday around 2:00pm</p>
	<p> 
		We are doing great and feel like our cup runneth over ＼（＾○＾）人（＾○＾）／ ٩◔‿◔۶
