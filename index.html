<p>On April 3rd Michelle woke up from a full night’s sleep feeling like today was going to be the day. She was eight days past her due
	date. She told me she felt a bit funny so I went to work. She had her first contraction in the car on the way to drop off Hakon 
	at daycare, the second leaving daycare, the third in Target - because we were not ready for a baby until we had another garbage
	can - and a fourth before she got home. She called me at work and I came home. We were both mentally prepared for a long ordeal.</p>
<p>When I got home we spent about an hour double checking that everything was packed and that our arrangements for Hakon were 
	ready to go. Michelle spent a lot of that time inflating an excercise ball that was then bounced on five or six times.
	The contractions were becoming less regular so she ate lunch and tried to take a nap for an hour. She had a previously scheduled
	check-in appointment with the midwives at Fairview at 1:30. After a short walk, we packed up the car hoping that we wouldn't have to go home after
	the appointment. Contractions at this point were between six and twelve minutes apart.<p>
<p>Michelle had an ultrasound which confirmed that the baby was low and in a good position for birth. We met with the midwife and although
	Michelle had been able to talk through all of her contractions, we were surprised to learn that she was four cm dilated. Ten cm is when you are ready
	for the infant to come out. They told us to 'mosey' over to the hospital, which was next door, but that if we wanted to stop somewhere for a 
	meal that that would be ok. The midwife then asked if they should sweep the membrane which is a way of moving the birth process along. 
	It should be advertised as a membrane tornado as from that point forward, labor and delivery progressed rapidly. Contractions at this 
	point were coming every five-six minutes.</p>
<p> When we got to the hospital, they had already been told we were coming by the mid-wives so we got to go straight to the delivery room, by-passing triage. The nurse got Michelle on the monitor and Michelle ordered some dinner. The general mood in the room was still one of strategizing a long term campaign to get this baby out. The contractions were getting a bit more painful but she could still talk through them. Michelle confirmed that she wanted access to nitrous and an epidural and the midwife assured Michelle that ‘it’s never too late to get an epidural’. </p>
<p>By 4:30, the initial monitoring was over so Michelle could leave the bed and walk around. I helped her walk over to the loo and then helped her change into hospital underwear. Her water had not even broken yet. We were standing next to the bed with no one else in the room, it’s about 4:45.  She grabbed the gas mask and my brain started to puzzle out that she was not miming yelling into the mask but actually yelling. The nurse walked in with the technician who would set up the epidural. He started prep work as Michelle leaned over the bed and at this point was screaming into the mask in a way that certainly got everyone’s attention. I think the technician knew that the next step in his procedure was to explain the risks and have Michelle sign some paperwork. I wish I could get a picture of that signature because I think it was the size of the page. It was indeed, too late to get an epidural. The nurse smartly told Michelle to hang on to me like we were slow dancing. That is exactly the position we were in when she gave birth. It is clear to me that slow dancing leads directly to babies. Things get a little hazy even for me during this time period. The dinner that was ordered arrived. Michelle’s body went slack for a bit and the mask slid out of her hand. She says that she felt like she was passing out in a movie where everyone’s voice is distant but she heard the nurse say to stay with us. I was babbling words of encouragement but I heard the nurse call for the midwife, then after the next contraction she called for ANYBODY. I wasn’t sure if something was going wrong but what was actually happening was that Signe’s face was in Michelle’s hospital underwear. The midwife arrived in time to catch the baby but just. There was one contraction for the head, one for the shoulders, and one for the rest. At 5:12, little Signe was born.</p>
<p>At 6:20 we ordered second dinner.</p>
